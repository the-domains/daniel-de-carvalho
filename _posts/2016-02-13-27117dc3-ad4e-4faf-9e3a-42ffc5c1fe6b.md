### Daniel de Carvalho

Speaker, Strategist, Communications Growth Specialist

# Why do today's organizations need a communications strategist?

A communications strategist consolidates all communications functions to deliver consistent messaging across varied channels and audiences, while ensuring preparedness for issues management and reputation control, especially when corporate activities spread over wider geographies.

A communications strategist creates systems to manage the increasing complexity caused by diverse audiences and an ever-growing number of channels, and helps the company's voice to be heard by the right audiences.

The achievement of business objectives is the ultimate goal of the communications strategy. Adequate measurements must be put in place to continuously track results and refine the approach.

# EXPERIENCE

* While overseeing the full scope of corporate communications, my main achievements from 2007 to 2012 were done in crisis communications, consumer communications and internal communications. Since then, in addition to the full scope of corporate communications, I could focus much more on developing equity stories as well as on government relations and public affairs. Prior to 2007 I worked for 6 years as a consultant in GT where after 3 years I made partner. During the full 6 years in this consultancy, I also worked on my own PR accounts. At GT we specialized on SME, and my clients included medical device manufacturers, as well as manufacturers of textiles and construction materials, and the PR work entailed change communication and employer branding.
* After concluding my studies and an internship in the PR and PA department of a US NGO I added commercial experience to my communications expertise and honed my leadership skills by working in commercial roles for the Portuguese Cable TV and the Bertelsman Group.
* Since 1994 I have conducted media trainings and crisis communication trainings for varied audiences, and have been engaged as a public speaker on a variety of subject matters.

# WIZZ AIR

Hired in early 2012 to introduce a Best-in-Class communications process, I identified that the Communications function in the company required to be structured and a fitting Communications Strategy needed to be created and implemented in a territory comprising almost 40 countries. 

I created the airline's communications and media travel policies, revised the airline's crisis management plan and repeatedly delivered media training for the authorized spokespeople. I recruited and shaped an in-house team of communications professionals and re-shaped the external agency network of over 10 PR agencies. 

I represent Wizz Air at high level speaking engagements and currently travel up to 70% of my time.

# RYANAIR

As Communications Manager for 26 European countries, reporting directly to the CEO and the head of international communications, I planned and implemented external and internal communication strategies, acted as spokesperson, presented the opening of 36 of the airline's 50 bases, over 900 of 1,400 routes and dozens of new services to the media in press conferences, media briefings or through press releases.

I regularly accompanied the CEO, CFO or CCO in press conferences when hosted by one of them. I supervised ten media agencies in different countries and worked with tourism boards to organize press trips into 160 different outlets.

I oversaw the PR support for route development, sales and marketing. As an internal leader of Ryanair's communication professionals, I redesigned the international internal communications for a team of 9,000 staff. I also revised and supervised the communication input of two revisions of the airline's crisis management plan.

# CONSULTANT

Reporting directly to the CEO, I was responsible for the business in Northern Portugal of this consulting company headquartered in Lisbon. In addition to working my own accounts, I directed strategic and operational sales and marketing activities, negotiated contracts with customers and partners, and directed project managers of consulting and training projects.

I also represented the company in trade fairs and press conferences. After three very successful years with the company, I made partner. Under my supervision and direction, the company's training division was certified by the European Union.

_Daniel's expertise lies in the areas of Strategic Communications, Public Affairs, Public Relation and Experiential Marketing.
